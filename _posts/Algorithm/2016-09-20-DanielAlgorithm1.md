1. Each node is composed of a data and a ==reference/link== to the next node in the sequence.

2. Simple and very common data structure !!!

3. They can be used to implement several other common data types: stacks,queues

4. The principal benefit of a linked list over a conventional array is that the list elements can easily be inserted or removed without reallocation or reorganization of the entire structure becuause the data items need not be stored in memory or on disk in one block.

5. An array has to be declared in the source code,before compiling and running the program!!!

6. On the other hand,simple linked lists by themselves do not allow random access to the data.

7. Many basic operations such as obtaining the last node of the list,or finding a node that contains a given data,or locating the place where a new node should be inserted -- may require sequential scanning of most or all of the list elements.






**After learning the linked list, let us enjoy the video --- "Driving with My Mum". Moretoki is driving a car with his mother. You can find the love between mother and son from this funny video.Evey mother wants to look ahead and see her son as a happy, healthy grown man.Can anything replace a mother's love and care?**

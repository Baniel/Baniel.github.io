## Why AlphaGo Special?

1. It is trained solely by self-paly reinforcement learning, starting from random play, without any supervision or use of human data.
2. It uses only the balck and white stones from the board as input features.
3. It uses a single neural network, rahter than separate policy and value networks.
4. It uses a simpler tree search that relies upon this single neural network to evaluate positions and sample moves without performing any Monte Carlo rollouts.

You may have heard that Li Fei-Fei has spent much money to collect the training data to make a machine to identify a dog or a cat, but AlphaGo without any training data. It means it will save much money and break the limit by training data.
